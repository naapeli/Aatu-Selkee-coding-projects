# 3D path-finding visualisation
This 3D path-finding visualisation tool is my most advanced project yet (fourth of june, 2023). It uses my knowledge in linear algebra (numpy), as well as pygame and tkinter. It also shows my knowledge in algorithms, such as dijkstra's algorithm and A*-algorithm. The project has a fully built up graphical user interface and supports customisation by the user via options.

This project originates from my need of applying my knowledge in linear algebra to some program. Often these sorts of projects are done in 2D, so I wanted to develop a project that uses vectors, matricies, rotations and projections to showcase differences between pathfinding algorithms. I also wanted to differentiate my self from others' work.

Another reason for creating this program was that path finding algorithms have many applications in real life. Visualising these algorithms that are used in navigation systems, robotics and supply chain management felt useful as these applications are vital for products we use every day. Therefore understanding these algorithms was important to me.

Overall creating this program was extremely interesting and rewarding. In the future I will continue creating more and more complicated programs in order to practice programming.

Here are some pictures from the program:
