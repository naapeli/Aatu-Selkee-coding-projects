# Machine learning digit recognition drawing software

This project originates from my interest in machine learning, spesifically deep learning. After reading a book called Deep Learning, written by John D. Kelleher (Syväoppiminen; kuinka tekoäly toimii, translated by Kimmo Pietiläinen), I wanted to apply my new-found knowledge in neural networks.

This program is designed to recognise hand-drawn digits from 0-9. With this program you are able to draw 32x32-pixel numbers onto a canvas, save the pictures, as well as determine the digits that are drawn onto the screen.

The intent behind this program was not to make the most beautiful GUI imaginable, but to make a program that showcases the neural networks ability to be applied to many different things. To me, image recognition using software is a little unintuitive, thus this project was natural to start off my machine learning tasks.

Here are some pictures from the program:
