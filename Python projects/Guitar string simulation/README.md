This is a fun little project at the end of my partial differential equations course. First I wanted to solve PDE's numerically using the finite difference method. In the end, the project included a little fourier analysis to get the harmonics for converting the vibrating string into sounds (inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MavAU3adGk4). After acquiring the guitar notes, I recreated a part of a song with them. Here is the result!
