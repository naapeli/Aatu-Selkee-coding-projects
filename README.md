# Coding portfolio
This will be used to sort and save my projects that I use to practise my Python- and Javascript-skills.

If you want to learn a little more from me, please check out the small chatbot project in python projects folder!

A few of my projects include:
1. Chess engine (Javascript, HTML, CSS) (work in progress)
2. 3D path-finding visualisation tool
3. Solving the wave equation for a guitar string and recreating a song with the notes
4. Flappy bird played by an artificial intelligence
5. Buffon's needle problem tool
6. Digit recognition program (neural network) (work in progress, pretty bad accuracy so far due to different image formats)
7. A chatbot that tells a little more about me
8. Climate data visualisation tool


Here are some pictures from the projects that I have done:
