# Coding portfolio
This repository is used to sort and save my projects for practicing Python and JavaScript skills. Larger projects, apart from the chess engine, are stored in their own public repositories, so be sure to check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/naapeli) for more details.



## Notable Projects:
1. [Chess engine](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Javascript%20projects/Chess%20engine) (Javascript, HTML, CSS)
2. [3D path-finding visualisation tool](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/3D%20path-finding%20visualisation)
3. Solving the wave equation for a guitar string and recreating a song with the notes. [Simulation](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/Guitar%20string%20simulation)
4. [Flappy bird](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/flappy%20bird%20machine%20learning) played by an artificial intelligence
5. [Buffon's needle problem tool](https://github.com/naapeli/Aatu-Selkee-coding-projects/tree/main/Python%20projects/Buffon's%20needle%20problem)
