# Coding portfolio
This will be used to sort and save my projects that I use to practise my Python- and Javascript-skills.

If you want to learn a little more from me, please check out the small chatbot project in python projects folder!

My projects include (from most complicated to least complicated):
1. 3D path-finding visualisation tool
2. Flappy bird played by an artificial intelligence
3. Buffon's needle problem tool
4. Digit recognition program (neural network) with ok accuracy
5. A chatbot that tells a little more about me
6. Climate data visualisation tool
7. A few solutions to Matt Parker's Math Puzzles
8. Some solutions to Leetcode problems (most solutions not included)
9. Some school excercises in my courses
10. A simple login-system that checks password and username from an excel-database
