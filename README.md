# Coding portfolio
This will be used to sort and save my projects that I use to practise my Python- and Javascript-skills.

If you want to learn a little more from me, please check out the small chatbot project in python projects folder!

My projects include (from most complicated to least complicated):
1. Chess engine (Javascript, HTML, CSS) (work in progress)
2. 3D path-finding visualisation tool
3. Flappy bird played by an artificial intelligence
4. Buffon's needle problem tool
5. Digit recognition program (neural network) (work in progress, pretty bad accuracy so far due to different image formats)
6. A chatbot that tells a little more about me
7. Climate data visualisation tool
8. A few solutions to Matt Parker's Math Puzzles
9. Some solutions to Leetcode problems (most solutions not included)
10. Some school excercises in my courses
11. A simple login-system that checks password and username from an excel-database

Here are some pictures from the projects that I have done:
